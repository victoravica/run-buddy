/*We just told every element on the page to not have any margin or border unless we explicitly tell it to. Now we don't have to concern ourselves with undoing built-in browser styles one by one.

The asterisk * we used here is used quite often in programming. It is typically called a wildcard, but in CSS it is known as a universal selector. This is essentially a catch-all selector that says, "I won't match one thingâ€”I'll match everything!"*/
